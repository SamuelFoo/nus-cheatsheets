# NUS Cheatsheets

Cheatsheets made for NUS CS

- Made by myself (with reference to lecture notes), and I omit things I'm comfortable with
- Generally require familiarity with the content to be used effectively
- Prepared for a particular semester, so page restriction or content might differ
- Use at your own risk

## Improvements I'm considering

- My `.tex` source files depend on "header" files I maintain for all `.tex` files - considering to decouple them
- Create a Makefile so that the compilation is reproducible
