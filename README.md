# NUS Cheatsheets

Cheatsheets made for NUS CS

- Made by myself (with reference to lecture notes), and I omit things I'm comfortable with
- Generally require familiarity with the content to be used effectively
- Prepared for a particular semester, so page restriction or content might differ
- Use at your own risk

## Improvements I'm considering

- My `.tex` source files depend on "header" files I maintain for all `.tex` files - considering to decouple them
- Create a Makefile so that the compilation is reproducible

## Modules

### CS2030S

Written for AY21/22 Sem 1 Finals. The notes are incomplete, because the finals for that particular semester was basically a practical assessment, so it was only important to know how Java works (and of course, OOP & FP concepts). You can find the PDF [here](CS2030S/CS2030S-AY2122S1-Finals.pdf).

### MA2001

Written for AY21/22 Sem 1 Finals. The finals were held online and you could use any amount of notes, but I made a 5 page summary to make it easier to find theorems. You can find the PDF [here](MA2001/MA2001-AY2122S1-Finals.pdf).
